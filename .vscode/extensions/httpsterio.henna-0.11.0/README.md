<h1 align="center">Henna Color Theme for Visual Studio Code</h1>

<p>Henna is a colour theme inspired by my green-eyed redhead girl. The colors are carefully selected with legibility and people with dyslexia in mind to create an accessible theme for Visual Studio Code</p>

<p>Download the theme on the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=httpsterio.henna">VSCode Extension marketplace</a> or <a href="https://github.com/httpsterio/vscode-henna">fork it on GitHub</a></p>

<p>Recommended font is <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> with <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions">font ligatures</a>.</p>
